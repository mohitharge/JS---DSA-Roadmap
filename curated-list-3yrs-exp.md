   * What is an execution context?
   * How does the call stack work in JS?
   * Explain the lifecycle of a script.

2. **Hoisting**

   * What gets hoisted: variables vs functions?
   * Difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in the context of hoisting.

3. **Closures**

   * What is a closure?
   * Real-world use case (e.g., data privacy, memoization).

4. **`this` Keyword**

   * How does `this` behave in:

     * Global scope
     * Object methods
     * Arrow functions
     * Callbacks
     * `bind`, `call`, `apply`

5. **Scoping**

   * Difference between function and block scope
   * Lexical scope

6. **Currying**

   * What is currying?
   * How to implement currying manually?

7. **Higher Order Functions**

   * What are they?
   * Examples: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

8. **Promises & Async/Await**

   * How Promises work
   * Difference between `.then` chaining and `async/await`
   * What is `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, `Promise.allSettled`

9. **Event Loop & Concurrency**

   * Explain JS event loop
   * Microtask vs Macrotask queue
   * What is the output of:

     ```js
     console.log(1);
     setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 0);
     Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(3));
     console.log(4);
     ```

10. **Memory Management**

    * Garbage collection basics
    * What is a memory leak?
    * How to avoid memory leaks in React?

### üîÑ Object-Oriented Concepts in JS

1. **Prototypes & Inheritance**

   * What is the prototype chain?
   * Difference between classical and prototypal inheritance

2. **`Object.create`, `Object.assign`, Spread vs Rest**

3. **Class vs Function Constructors**

---

### üß™ Data Types and Behavior

1. **Primitive vs Non-Primitive**

2. **Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference**

3. **Type Coercion & Equality**

   * Difference between `==` and `===`
   * Truthy/Falsy values

4. **Destructuring, Spread/Rest Operator**

### üõ†Ô∏è Functions and Patterns

1. **Debounce vs Throttle**
2. **Memoization**
3. **Function Composition**
4. **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Miscellaneous (Highly Asked)

1. **Event Delegation**
2. **Custom Events**
3. **Shallow vs Deep Copy**
4. **Polyfills** (e.g., for `map`, `bind`, `Promise`)
5. **Difference between `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`**
6. **Difference between `for`, `for...in`, `for...of`**
7. **Set vs Map vs Object**
8. **JSON.stringify vs JSON.parse use cases**
9. **Optional chaining and nullish coalescing (`?.` and `??`)**
10. **What is a Symbol and when would you use it?**

---

### Bonus for Product Companies:

* How would you optimize a large array operation in JS?
* How do you manage large JSON data in frontend?
* Real-world usage of closures or currying in production?
* Explain how `debounce` helps in improving performance in React components like search inputs.
* When would you use `Map` over `Object`?

### üöÄ Prep Tips:

* Practice problems on [JS info](https://javascript.info/), [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com), or [LeetCode JS tags](https://leetcode.com/problemset/?difficulty=Easy&status=Todo&tags=javascript).
* Be **clear with definitions**, **have at least one real-world use case**, and **know how to implement or polyfill it** if needed.
