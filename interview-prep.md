## ✅ **1. Understand the Interview Focus Areas**

Since it’s the first round (likely technical), expect:

### 🔹 **Core Technical Skills**

* **React.js** and **Next.js**: Lifecycle, hooks (`useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`), SSR/SSG, routing, dynamic imports.
* **TypeScript** basics: interfaces, types, generics, type narrowing (practice converting JS code to TS).
* **Redux Toolkit**: creating slices, thunk middleware, and dev tools setup.
* **Tailwind CSS**: utility-first styling, responsive layouts, customizing themes.
* **React Native** (you’re new, so show learning mindset): understand `View`, `Text`, navigation, and basic differences from web React.
* **Testing**: Write basic tests using **Jest** (unit tests) and **Cypress/Playwright** (e2e/browser).

### 🔹 **Systems Thinking & Best Practices**

* Component architecture, state management decisions, performance optimizations (lazy loading, memoization).
* Code splitting in Next.js.
* Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav).
* DX (Developer Experience): tooling, linters, structure.

## ✅ **2. Prepare Your Pitch**

### 💡 30-sec Intro:

> “Hi, I’m Mohit, a frontend developer with 3 years of experience primarily working in React and Next.js. I’ve worked on scalable applications, handled state using Redux, and focused heavily on performance and user experience. While I haven’t worked in React Native or TypeScript full-time, I’ve started upskilling in both and feel confident in picking them up quickly given my strong JavaScript base.”

## ✅ **3. Study These Topics**

### 📌 JavaScript / TypeScript:

* Closure, event loop, `this`, async/await, promise chaining.
* Convert JS to TS: `type` vs `interface`, `Record`, `Partial`, `Pick`, etc.
* Utility types: `typeof`, `keyof`, `ReturnType`.

### 📌 React:

* Controlled vs uncontrolled components.
* React performance optimization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).
* Custom hooks and when to create them.
* Error boundaries.

### 📌 Next.js:

* Difference between SSR, SSG, ISR.
* API routes and middleware.
* `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, `getInitialProps`.

### 📌 Redux Toolkit:

* Slices, async thunks.
* Middlewares.
* Selector memoization.

## ✅ **4. Projects & Experience Questions**

Be ready to discuss:

* A tough bug you fixed and how you debugged it.
* A feature you built from scratch: requirements → design → delivery.
* When you optimized performance.
* Team collaboration example (especially mentoring or cross-functional work).

---

## ✅ **5. Reverse Interview**

They love proactive people. Prepare questions like:

* “How is the frontend team structured?”
* “How do you handle cross-platform component sharing between React and React Native?”
* “What’s the testing strategy for major releases?”
* “How often do developers interact with product/design teams?”

---

## ✅ **6. Bonus: Start Learning React Native & TS Now**

Just enough to hold a basic conversation:

* [React Native docs (official)](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
* [TypeScript for React Devs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html)
* Build a basic React Native ToDo app using Expo if time allows.

---

## ✅ **7. Mock Interview (Optional but Powerful)**

If you want, I can conduct a mock interview tomorrow with:

* React/JS questions
* Code snippets
* System design (FE-specific)
* Behavioral questions
